This is the sql input of the current_date fucntion being used to be selected in the system for allowing the use of the days data and analysis
I have used the current data formula that is entered where there is the INSERT INTO `table`(name, date) VALUES ('Osimehn', CURRENT_DATE);
This feature makes it easy for getting the current date when the data was entered by the user automatically.
